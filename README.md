# RISC-Processor-Design
RISC Processor Design | Computer Organization Laboratory | Prof. Indranil Sengupta Oct 2023 - Nov 2023
• Built 32-bit RISC processor in Verilog integrating ALU, control unit, registers, separate instruction & data memory (Harvard Architecture)
• Designed micro-programmed control unit capable of generating control signals for 150+ microinstructions corresponding to the RISC ISA
• Implemented 5-stage pipeline including Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access & Write Back stages to maximize instruction throughput
• Built an assembler in python & validated execution of assembly code (Bubble sort & GCD computation) on a Nexys A7-100T FPGA board
